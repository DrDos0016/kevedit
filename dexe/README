How to make a DEXE
------------------

1) Make a regular hdimage: mkfatimage16 -k (size in kb) >hdimage
2) Use DOSEMU and the FreeDOS install disk to format hdimage and make it
   bootable
3) Copy the desired files onto the hdimage
4) MAKE A BACKUP OF HDIMAGE!!!
5) Turn the hdimage into a dexe by applying the config file:
   dexeconfig -M -i dconfig hdimage
6) Rename hdimage to file.dexe

And that's how to make a DEXE.
