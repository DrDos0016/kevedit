:name;World Name

The name of the world need not necessarily
match the filename of the world, although
it usually should (minus the .zzt
extension).

If a different name is used, that name
will appear under the word "World" on the
title screen menu in ZZT.  When a user
quits from the world, then presses 'p' to
play again, a different world will be
loaded! Simply use a filename for the
second world based on the name of the
first world.

Example:

The player loads "test.zzt" which has the
name "newworld". After the player dies in
"test.zzt", they press 'p' to play again,
but instead of starting in "test.zzt", zzt
loads them into "newworld.zzt". Consult
the ZZT Encyclopedia Online for an
example.

:keys;Keys

Keys which the player possesses are
displayed as keys. Doors represent keys
which the player could obtain. Place the
cursor over a key or door and press ENTER
or SPACEBAR to give or take that key from
the player.

:inv;Inventory

The initial inventory of the player may be
modified easily. Pressing ENTER edits the
value of the item. Left and right change
the value by ten units at a time. To
change the value by one unit at a time,
use '+' and '-'.

:misc;Miscellaneous

Torch Cycles
 * Usually used exclusively in saved
   games, the number of torch cycles
   remaining indicates how long the player
   has before a torch burns out.
Energizer Cycles
 * Energizer cycles, by a similar measure,
   indicate how much longer an energizer
   will last.
Time Elapsed
 * How much time within the current
   board's timelimit countdown has been
   used up
Is Saved Game
 * For saved games, this is set to true,
   and is false for normal worlds. ZZT
   uses the same file format for both
   worlds and saved games, using this flag
   to ensure that one does not impersonate
   the other. ZZT will not play or edit
   saved games and will not restore
   worlds, regardless of extension.

:flags;Set/Clear Flags

Pressing enter on the Set/Clear Flags
option will present a list of the
currently set flags. DELETE or BACKSPACE
will clear a flag.

ZZT supports up to ten flags. The order of
the flags is determined by zzt. When a
flag is set, it is placed in the first
available slot and removed from that slot
when cleared. Thus the order of the flags
is completely arbitrary, but may be useful
in debugging saved games.
