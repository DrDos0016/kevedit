Running ZZT under DOSBox
------------------------
ZZT works great in DOSBox.  To automatically test worlds, we set up the
following virtual DOS drives:

C:	-> ISO image containing ZZT runtime files
D:	-> Temporary directory containing TEST.ZZT (created by KevEdit)

DOSBox starts up, and mounts those virtual drives.  It runs skip.com, a simple
program that injects [K] [C] [ENTER] into the keyboard buffer, conveniently
skipping over the ZZT intro crap.  Then it runs C:ZZT D:TEST to launch ZZT with
the test world.  When ZZT exits, DOSBox runs EXIT, terminating the emulator.

Painless! :)

(Note: zzt.exe and zzt.dat are in the public domain.  I wrote skip.com, and
that is in the public domain also.  Have fun with that.)
