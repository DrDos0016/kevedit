KevEdit 0.1
	A world file editor for the game ZZT

Copyright (C) 2000 Kev Vance <kvance@tekktonik.net>

 * This is nowhere near finished.  The main purpose of 0.1 is to create art
   for the 24AHoZ compo.

Things that are implemented so far:

 * MOVING - arrows to move, alt+arrows to move faster
 * QUITTING - press 'q' to quit.  No confirmation, hope you saved.
 * DEFC - Default colour mode.  Press 'd' to toggle this, KevEdit is lots more
   fun with this turned off.
 * DRAWING - Press tab to toggle draw mode
 * BLINKING - Press 'v' to toggle blinking
 * PLOTTING - Press space to plot
 * COLOURS - Lots of colours are available.  'c' to change foreground colours,
   shift+'c' to change background colours.
 * PATTERNS - A full gradient of patterns along with lines and a large
   backbuffer (bigger than ZZT's 1 block only :) are available.  'p' to change
 * BOARDS - 'b' will bring up the board scroll where you can switch boards
   or create new ones.
 * SAVING - 's' to save the world file
 * LOADING - 'l' to load a world file
 * HELP - 'h' for help, which is just the About box now
 * THINGS - Some things, like keys and doors can go in.  Lots of others are
   not coded in yet.
 * OBJECTS - Object support is in, but just for making custom chars.  There is
   no program editor yet (but you'll dig the superior char-picker :)
 * GRABBING - Press enter to grab something to the backbuffer.  Gotta love
   the big backbuffer.
--------------------------------------------

That's all I can think of.  This is not supported at this time, please do not
send me email asking how to use it.

If you find bugs, try to fix it and send me a patch :)  If you can't fix it,
report it.

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/kevedit/ is where you can check for new
releases, get the CVS code, post bug reports, etc.
