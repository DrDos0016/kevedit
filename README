KevEdit 0.4.0
                     Powerful ZZT Editing
-----------------------------------------
Copyright (C) 2000-2002 Kev Vance  <kev@kvance.com>
With many contributions by bitman  <bitman@users.sf.net>

Getting Started With KevEdit
----------------------------
Copy the binary KEVEDIT.EXE and the help file KEVEDIT.ZML to your ZZT
directory.  You can run it with no arguments to get a blank new world, or give
it a world on the command line to
load it.

Example:
C> kevedit town.zzt

This will load town.zzt into the editor if it exists.  Otherwise, a new world
will be created.

To learn more about using KevEdit, activate its on-line help by pressing 'H'.

NOTE: The "ZZT Documentation" category of online help does not accompany
KevEdit. If you install any extended help files to either the same directory as
KevEdit or the "docs" subfolder, then you can browse them as in ZZT. "About
ZZT" will load the opening about file, "Playing ZZT" will load the help file
accessed by the 'H' key in ZZT, and "ZZT Editor" will load the editor help
file. Note that for Chronos' ZZTWeb these files will all be the same.

KevEdit 0.4.0 represents a major milestone in the development of KevEdit. The
internal structure of the program has been completely redesigned for maximum
stability and extendability. This release is both a long-over due end in itself
and also a jumping-off point for further extensions and features. What more
could possibly be in store? You shall have to wait to find out...

Blatant Plug of ZZTUnder Project
--------------------------------
To associate KevEdit with ZZT files anywhere on your hard-drive, install "ZZT
Under Windows" with KevEdit support and then extract the KevEdit distribution
into the ZZT Under Windows folder. If extended help is installed in ZZTUWin, it
will also be available in KevEdit. ZZT Under Windows can be aquired in the
Utilities section of zzt2.com or from http://zztunder.tk/ .

Post Script
-----------
Technical support for KevEdit is not guaranteed. However, you are encouraged to
send an email to bitman <bitman@users.sf.net> if you have any questions,
problems, or praise. Also consider posting to the "ZZT Editors" forum on
zzt2.com if you have a general question. For announcements and technical
discussion of KevEdit, join the kevedit-talk mailing list by visiting:

https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/kevedit-talk

If you find bugs, try to fix it and send in a patch :)  If you can't fix it,
report it. For the overzelous, you can do what bitman did join in on the
development if you find sending in patches too tedious. CVS is great for that
sort of thing.

http://kevedit.sourceforge.net/ is where you can check for new releases, get
the CVS code, post bug reports, etc.
