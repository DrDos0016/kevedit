KevEdit 0.3.4
     A world file editor for the game ZZT
-----------------------------------------
Copyright (C) 2000-2001 Kev Vance  <kev@kvance.com>
With many contributions by bitman  <bitman@users.sf.net>

Getting Started With KevEdit
----------------------------
Copy the binary KEVEDIT.EXE and the help file KEVEDIT.ZML to your ZZT
directory.  You can run it with no arguments to get a blank new world, or give
it a world on the command line to
load it.

Example:
C> kevedit town.zzt

This will load town.zzt into the editor if it exists.  Otherwise, a new world
will be created.

To learn more about using KevEdit, activate its on-line help by pressing 'H'.

The "ZZT Documentation" category of online help does not accompany KevEdit. If
you install any extended help files to either the same directory as KevEdit or
the "docs" subfolder, then you can browse them as in ZZT. "About ZZT" will load
the opening about file, "Playing ZZT" will load the help file accessed by the
'H' key in ZZT, and "ZZT Editor" will load the editor help file. Note that for
Chronos' ZZTWeb these files will all be the same.

New Features / Bug Fixes
------------------------
New features in 0.3.5
  * ZZT Music Testing
	* Support for extended help when running ZZT
Bugs fixed in 0.3.5

Blatant Plug of ZZT Under Windows
---------------------------------
To associate KevEdit with ZZT files anywhere on your hard-drive, install "ZZT
Under Windows" with KevEdit support and then extract the KevEdit distribution
into the ZZT Under Windows folder. If extended help is installed in ZZTUWin, it
will also be available in KevEdit. ZZT Under Windows can be aquired in the
Utilities section of zzt2.com.

Post Script
-----------
Technical support for KevEdit is not guaranteed. However, you are encouraged to
send an email to bitman <bitman@users.sf.net> if you have any questions,
problems, or praise. Also consider posting to the "ZZT Editors" forum on
zzt2.com if you have a general question. For announcements and technical discussion of KevEdit, join the kevedit-talk mailing list by visiting:

https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/kevedit-talk

If you find bugs, try to fix it and send in a patch :)  If you can't fix it,
report it. For the overzelous, you can do what bitman did join in on the
development if you find sending in patches too tedious. CVS is great for that
sort of thing.

http://kevedit.sourceforge.net/ is where you can check for new releases, get
the CVS code, post bug reports, etc.
