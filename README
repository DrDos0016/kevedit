                     Powerful ZZT Editing
-----------------------------------------
Copyright (C) 2000-2002 Kev Vance  <kev@kvance.com>
With many contributions by bitman  <bitman@users.sf.net>

Getting Started With KevEdit
----------------------------
Copy the binary KEVEDIT.EXE and the help file KEVEDIT.ZML to your ZZT
directory.  You can run it with no arguments to get a blank new world, or give
it a world on the command line to load it.

Example:
C> kevedit town.zzt

This will load town.zzt into the editor if it exists.  Otherwise, a new world
will be created.

To learn more about using KevEdit, activate its on-line help by pressing 'H'.

Blatant Plug of ZZTUnder Project
--------------------------------
For better documentation, install KevEdit and ZZT Under Windows into the same
folder. If extended help is installed with ZZTUWin then it will be made
available to KevEdit when testing ZZT worlds and in KevEdit's online help. ZZT
Under Windows can be aquired in the Utilities section of zzt2.com or from
http://zztunder.tk/ .

Post Script
-----------
Technical support for KevEdit is not guaranteed. However, you are encouraged to
send an email to bitman <bitman@users.sf.net> if you have any questions,
problems, or praise. Also consider posting to the "ZZT Editors" forum on
zzt2.com if you have a general question. For announcements and technical
discussion of KevEdit, join the kevedit-talk mailing list by visiting:

https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/kevedit-talk

If you find bugs, try to fix it and send in a patch :)  If you can't fix it,
report it. For the overzelous, you can do what bitman did join in on the
development if you find sending in patches too tedious. CVS is great for that
sort of thing.

http://kevedit.sourceforge.net/ is where you can check for new releases, get
the CVS code, post bug reports, etc.
