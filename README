Copyright (C) 2000-2001 Kev Vance  <kev@kvance.com>
With many contributions by bitman  <bitman@users.sf.net>

Getting Started With KevEdit
----------------------------
Copy the binary KEVEDIT.EXE to your ZZT directory.  You can run it with no
arguments to get a blank new world, or give it a world on the command line to
load it.

Example:
C> kevedit town.zzt

This will load town.zzt into the editor if it exists.  Otherwise, a new world
will be created.

To learn more about using KevEdit, activate its on-line help by pressing
'H'.

Post Script
-----------
Though KevEdit is not supported at present, you can send emails to bitman
<bitman_squared@hotmail.com> if you can't figure something out or just don't
like it. Also, the kevedit-talk mailing list is a good source of updates on the
development of KevEdit.

If you find bugs, try to fix it and send in a patch :)  If you can't fix it,
report it. For the overzelous, you can do what I (bitman) did join in on the
development if you find sending in patches too tedious. CVS is great for that
sort of thing.

http://kevedit.sourceforge.net/ is where you can check for new releases, get
the CVS code, post bug reports, etc.
