     A world file editor for the game ZZT
-----------------------------------------
Copyright (C) 2000-2001 Kev Vance  <kev@kvance.com>
With many contributions by bitman  <bitman@users.sf.net>

Getting Started With KevEdit
----------------------------
Copy the binary KEVEDIT.EXE and the help file KEVEDIT.ZML to your ZZT
directory.  You can run it with no arguments to get a blank new world, or give
it a world on the command line to
load it.

Example:
C> kevedit town.zzt

This will load town.zzt into the editor if it exists.  Otherwise, a new world
will be created.

To learn more about using KevEdit, activate its on-line help by pressing 'H'.

For even more extended help, download the ZZTWeb from Chronos' website at
http://members.aol.com/chronos30/ and unzip the .hlp files into the same folder as KEVEDIT.HLP. Do not, at this time, run the installation batch file.

New Features / Bug Fixes
------------------------
New features in 0.3.4
  * Multi-directory file dialogs
	* Goes directly to the title screen when running ZZT worlds
Bugs fixed in 0.3.4
  * Infrequent help system crash repaired

Blatant Plug of ZZT Under Windows
---------------------------------
To associate KevEdit with ZZT files anywhere on your hard-drive, install "ZZT
Under Windows" with KevEdit support and then extract the KevEdit distribution
into the ZZT Under Windows folder. ZZT Under Windows can be aquired in the
Utilities section of zzt.org.

Post Script
-----------
Though KevEdit is not supported at present, you can send emails to bitman
<bitman_squared@hotmail.com> if you can't figure something out or just don't
like it. Also, the kevedit-talk mailing list is a good source of updates on the
development of KevEdit. To join the mailing list, visit
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/kevedit-talk

If you find bugs, try to fix it and send in a patch :)  If you can't fix it,
report it. For the overzelous, you can do what bitman did join in on the
development if you find sending in patches too tedious. CVS is great for that
sort of thing.

http://kevedit.sourceforge.net/ is where you can check for new releases, get
the CVS code, post bug reports, etc.
