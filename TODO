For the 0.4.x release:
----------------------
Many tiles with parameters do not use the under-colour/type option when they
	are actually displayed.  Find these and fix the display routines and
	plot routines.  The background colours are added to the tile colour
	at plot time.

For the 0.5 release:
--------------------
Block copy/paste/move/export/import
ANSI file support (as much as ZZT can do)
Multiple backbuffers and toolkit file format

For the 0.6 release:
--------------------
Configurable keybindings
UNIX, here we come!
